Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
Did he smile his work to see?
What the hand, dare seize the fire?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What immortal hand or eye,
What immortal hand or eye,
What the hammer? what the chain,
In what furnace was thy brain?
In what distant deeps or skies.
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
When the stars threw down their spears
And water'd heaven with their tears:
And when thy heart began to beat.
What the anvil? what dread grasp.
What dread hand? & what dread feet?
In the forests of the night:
In the forests of the night;
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
And what shoulder, & what art,
Tyger Tyger burning bright,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
