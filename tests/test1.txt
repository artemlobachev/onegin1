I cannot ease your aching heart,
Nor take your pain away,
But let me stay and take your hand
And walk with you today
I’ll listen when you need to talk,
I’ll wipe away your tears,
I’ll share your worries when they come,
I’ll help you face your fears.
I’m here, and I will stand by you
On each hill you have to climb.
So take my hand, let’s face the world
And live one day at a time!
You’re not alone, for I’m still here.
I’ll go that extra mile.
And when your grief is easier,
I’ll help you learn to smile.
