On each hill you have to climb.
So take my hand, let’s face the world
But let me stay and take your hand
I’ll go that extra mile.
I’ll help you learn to smile. 
And live one day at a time!
I’ll share your worries when they come,
You’re not alone, for I’m still here.
I’ll listen when you need to talk,
And when your grief is easier,
I’ll help you face your fears.
I’ll wipe away your tears,
I cannot ease your aching heart,
I’m here, and I will stand by you
And walk with you today
Nor take your pain away,
