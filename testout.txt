And water'd heaven with their tears:
And what shoulder, & what art,
And when thy heart began to beat.
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
In the forests of the night;
In the forests of the night:
In what distant deeps or skies.
In what furnace was thy brain?
On what wings dare he aspire?
Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
Tyger Tyger burning bright,
What dread hand? & what dread feet?
What immortal hand or eye,
What immortal hand or eye,
What the anvil? what dread grasp.
What the hammer? what the chain,
What the hand, dare seize the fire?
When the stars threw down their spears
